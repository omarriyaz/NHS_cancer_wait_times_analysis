# Cancer Waiting Times Dataset Analysis

This project aims to analyze the Cancer Waiting Times dataset from the Public Health Scotland (PHS) Open Data platform. The dataset provides statistics on the 62-day standard for patients urgently referred with a suspicion of cancer and the 31-day standard for patients referred regardless of the route from the date of the decision to treat to the first cancer treatment. It includes data on various cancer types, broken down by NHS Board and Council Area across Scotland.

The primary objective of this analysis is to provide insights into cancer waiting times across different NHS boards and council areas, focusing on specific cancer types and treatment timelines. The analysis will help identify patterns, trends, and areas that may require improvement in cancer care delivery in Scotland. The project uses the dataset to answer specific questions about cancer treatment timelines, focusing on regional variations, trends over time, and specific cancer types, such as Head & Neck, Lung, and Breast cancer.
